# Introduction

This repository contains code used in the paper: **"Progress, challenges and opportunities for plant Red Listing"**.  

All analysis was run in R aside from the workflow for [Figure 1](https://github.com/stevenpbachman/RedList_Challenges/blob/master/03_figs/fig_1.jpg) (Microsoft powerpoint) and the map for [Figure 3](https://github.com/stevenpbachman/RedList_Challenges/blob/master/03_figs/fig_3.jpg) (ArcMap 10.3).

See [Methods_description.md](https://github.com/stevenpbachman/RedList_Challenges/blob/master/Methods.md) for detailed methods.
